\section{Introduction}
\Biocpkg{blimaTestingData} has been created mainly to show basic work with a \Biocpkg{blima} package. This manual will provide you with a step by step process how to prepare your data for processing with a \Biocpkg{blima} package. In fact the core data object is a \Rclass{list} of \Rclass{beadLevelData} objects from the package \Biocpkg{beadarray}.

The package \Biocpkg{blima} was developed to make analysis of Illumina bead level data possible without the need of summarizing them according to probes prior to differential expression testing.

The data in \Biocpkg{blimaTestingData} are derived from the  NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus dataset \href{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56129}{GSE56129}. The set were prepared using microarray images of human mesenchymal cells treated with various supplements. Set was uploaded primarily to be a supporting dataset for the package blima. The dataset contains 9 Illumina array spots representing 3 different treatment conditions of human mesenchymal cells. First two conditions in quadruplicate and third condition on single array.
