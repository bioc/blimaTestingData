\section{Creating annotation object}
Now we create annotation object as a representation of manufacturer text file provided as annotation. For the annotation of the data provided in the \Biocpkg{blimaTestingData} package is in Bioconductor the package \Biocpkg{illuminaHumanv4.db} but it slightly deviate from the data provided by Illumina in file  Illumina/annotation/HumanHT-12\_V4\_0\_R2\_15002873\_B.txt. So if we have to use original annotation (for example for GEO submission purposes) we should use data from manufacturer annotation file. In the following text we show how to create representation of the manufacturer annotation file as the object \Robject{annotationHumanHT12V4}.
