These are the basic commands to load \Robject{blimatesting} object. As was already mentioned this object is simply \Rclass{list} of two \Rclass{beadLevelData} objects. Package \Biocpkg{blima} and its functions can work with a lists of \Robject{beadLevelData} or single \Robject{beadLevelData} object as input. This is due to the fact, that analysis such as quantile normalization can be carried out across multiple arrays or array kits. Object \Robject{beadLevelData} usually represent one bead array kit with some arrays on it. If user wants to work with multiple kits, they could simply put all the array kits to one list and work with this object inside package \Biocpkg{blima}. It is also possible to provide list of logical vectors corresponding to particular arrays to process only selected arrays in the analysis object.
